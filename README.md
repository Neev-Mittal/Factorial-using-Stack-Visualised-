# Factorial-using-Stack-Visualised-
C code to visually represent how factorial is calculated using the stack data structure using the graphics.h library

The file format is of C++ because I was using Embarcadero Dev C++ as the runtime environment (which causes some issues) and not TurboC, but the code will run just fine with the .C extension.
